### This project accompanies a *Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment* Letter to the Editor that comments on [Addicott et al. (2022)](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/fee.2530). We highlight an alternative approach to their analysis in which uncertainty in the first stage is propagated to the second.
